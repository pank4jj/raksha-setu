-- RakshaSetu ??" Reset/delete policies
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor AFTER 0001..0008
-- ============================================================
-- The demo-reset endpoint deletes simulated incidents and their
-- assignments. No FOR DELETE policy existed, so RLS silently
-- denied every delete and the Reset button did nothing while
-- reporting success.
-- Idempotent: safe to run multiple times.
